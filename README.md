# Customer Support AI Agent for E-commerce Product Troubleshooting

A production-ready AI agent that provides intelligent customer support for e-commerce platforms by answering product-specific questions and troubleshooting common issues using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and asynchronous MQTT communication.

### Project Overview
This AI agent serves as the first line of support for customers of an e-commerce store, dramatically reducing manual support costs while improving resolution times. The system intelligently answers product questions, troubleshoots common issues, and escalates complex cases to human agents when needed.

- Intelligent Product Support: Answers detailed product questions using knowledge base
- Troubleshooting Workflows: Guides users through step-by-step issue resolution
- Asynchronous Communication: Real-time interactions via MQTT messaging protocol
- RAG-Powered Knowledge Retrieval: Context-aware answers from product documentation
- Multi-Tool Agent Architecture: Combines knowledge retrieval with API integrations
- Production Monitoring: Prometheus metrics for latency, error rates, and token usage
- Dockerized Deployment: Easy setup and scaling with containerization
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions.
